<h1>My Trip Around the USA on a Segway Segway'n USA</h1>

<h2>Documenting my trip around the US on my very own Segway!</h2>

<h3>August 20, 2012</h3>
<p>Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed
through some interesting places on the way: 
     <ol>
        <li>Walla Walla, WA, </li>
        <li>Magic City,ID,</li> 
        <li>Bountiful, UT,</li>
        <li>Last Chance, CO,</li>
        <li>Truth or Consequences, NM, Why, AZ</li>
     </ol>

<p>I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today:
     <blockquote>
     "Passing cars, <br> When you can't see, May get you, A glimpse, Of eternity."
     </blockquote>
I definitely won't be passing any cars.

<h3>June 2, 2012</h3>
<p>My first day of the trip!  I can't believe I finally got
everything packed and ready to go.  Because I'm on a Segway,
I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me: 

   <ul>
   <li>cellphone, </li>
   <li>iPod, </li>
   <li>digital camera, </li>
   <li>and a protein bar </li>
</ul>

Just the essentials.  As Lao Tzu would have said, "A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segway."
